  @json

 An ORM is an Object Relational Mapping that defines the relationship between object oriented type
 definitions and relational tables or views in a database. This implementation is currently designed
 to apply specifically to a PostgreSQL database, but theoretically could be applied to any database
 for which an ORM API is defined to process these definitions.

 In the xTuple PostgreSQL implmentation the installation of ORM files triggers views to be created
 whose structures and rules conform to the definition of the ORM. The ORMs use camel and class case
 conventions when referencing object attributes and snake case conventions when referencing database
 attributes. Because ORMs generates views, these views can in turn be referenced by other ORMs to manage
 a class hierachy. To determine the name of a view created by an ORM simply convert the name space
 qualified type of the object to a snake case schema and view name like so:

 Object Name      Datbase Name
 --------------   ----------------
 XM.Contact       xm.contact
 XM.ToDo          xm.to_do
 XM.ToDoComment   xm.to_do_comment

 ORMs are specifically designed to be extensible so that a database table can be virtually expanded
 without changing the original table definition, while presenting the new data through the ORM API
 as though it were all one unit. This effectively ensures that "core" database definitions
 and custom or 3rd party data extensions are effectively encapuslated from one another. In addition
 ORMs can be activated and deactivated in the xt.orm table so extensions can be "turned off" at
 any time.

 The initial ORM is referred to as the "base" ORM. Additional ORMs can be defined against the
 original base using the same name space and type but giving them a different context name and
 setting the isExtension flag to true. Typically the table on an ORM extension should reside in a
 different database schema where you would create a table with colums that contain data you want to
 "add" to a table in the original schema. The new table should contain a column relation to associate
 with the original (which may also be the primary key for it as well.) When you create an ORM
 extension the new table will be left joined on the original. Any inserts, updates or delete
 actions will propagate results to both the original and the new table automatically.

 Extensions can be created as both completely independent ORM definitions or added to an
 extension array on a base or extension ORM.
